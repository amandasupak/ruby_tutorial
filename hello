# this file does not have the .rb at the end of the file name
# because the filename itself is the user interface, 
# and thereâ€™s no reason to expose the implementation language to the user.
# it also allows you to rewrite the scrpit in another language without
# changing the command our program's users have to type

# TO RUN on command line
# > ruby hello
# or use 
# > chmod -x hello
# > ./hello
